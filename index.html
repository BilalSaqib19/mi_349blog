    <h2>  Game monetization Today</h2>
 <a href="about.html">  By Bilal Saqib </a> 
 <p> Published on <time datetime="2022-10-16"> October 16th 2022</time></p>

<p>Monetization has been a continuous issue in the modern gaming age. Recently a video game by the name Overwatch 2 was released. If a new player would start the game, they would have to pay over 12,000 dollars to gather every single item. The game is free to play to counter that fact. This type of business model has many gamers trapped into paying more than the price of a standard game. Battle passes which have been introduced by fortnite, are another system that have been feeding on gamers wallets.</p>
<h3>What is a battle pass?</h3>
<p>Battle passes are a type of timed event reward system that reward players for playing and doing challenges. This hooks players into playing the game in fear of losing out from rewards. These limited time events make playing the game a chore, and less like entertainment.</p>

<h3>What can gamers do to combat these issues?</h3>
<p>Some good ways to combat this modern monetization system in video games is to not buy them or play them. It is unfortunate that it has come to this, but boycotting these types of games might be the best option. Gamers can also support games that do not have these models. Popular games like Hollow Knight or Cup Head have no modern monetization systems. After you buy the game, you keep it forever! Here are a few others examples of good games to support.</p>

    <h2 >What makes a game captivating?</h2>
<a href="about.html">  By Bilal Saqib </a> 
<p> Published on <time datetime="2022-10-16"> October 16th 2022</time></p>
<p>There are many reasons why individuals play video games. E-sports have been increasingly more popular in schools and media. Video games have been introduced to younger generations. I believe there are 4 key reasons that make games so captivating. </p>

<ul> <li>1.Progression</li>
    <li>2.Mechanics</li>
    <li>3.Story</li> 
    <li>4.Atmosphere</li> 
 </ul>
 <H3>Progression</H3>
 <p>Every great game keeps gamers hooked. The combination of new objectives and new goals keeps players intrigued. A game with slow or fast progression keeps players away from the  game for longer periods of time. </p>
 <H3>Mechanics</H3>
 <p>The first time you are allowed to move in a game is a big deal. Mechanics are the bridge from the player to the game. Games with bad mechanics do not survive. A game with great mechanics can survive with simple graphics and audio. </p>
 <h3>Story</h3>
<p>A great story sticks with people even after they finish the game. The story can keep audiences engaged. The best games of all time, also have some of the best stories of all time. A good story can make a good game, and an incredible game. </p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Graphics and audio for games are incredibly important. Whenever I think of Mario, I can still hear the 1-1 level theme. Audio is not just music, but all the sounds you hear. Making them sound real to the game world really keeps players entranced. Art styles can really differentiate your game from other publishers' titles. Games like Okami<img src="OkamiPictureTown.jpg" class="okami" width="400" height="400" alt="Picture from Okami"> have been praised even to this day for their art style.</p>
