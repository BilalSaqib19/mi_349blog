    <hl> The downfall of video game monetization</hl>
<p>Monetization has been a continuous issue in the modern gaming age. Recently a video game by the name Overwatch 2 was released. If a new player would start the game, they would have to pay over 12,000 dollars to gather every single item. The game is free to play to counter that fact. This type of business model has many gamers trapped into paying more than the price of a standard game. Battle passes which have been introduced by fortnite, are another system that have been feeding on gamers wallets.</p>
