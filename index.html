 <h2>Monetization Today</h2>

<p>Monetization has been a continuous issue in the modern gaming age. Recently a video game by the name Overwatch 2 was released. If a new player would start the game, they would have to pay over 12,000 dollars to gather every single item. The game is free to play to counter that fact. This type of business model has many gamers trapped into paying more than the price of a standard game. Battle passes which have been introduced by fortnite, are another system that have been feeding on gamers wallets.</p>
<h3>What is a battle pass?</h3>
<p>Battle passes are a type of timed event reward system that reward players for playing and doing challenges. This hooks players into playing the game in fear of losing out from rewards. These limited time events make playing the game a chore, and less like entertainment.</p>
<h3>What can gamers do to combat these issues?</h3>
<p>Some good ways to combat this modern monetization system in video games is to not buy them or play them. It is unfortunate that it has come to this, but boycotting these types of games might be the best option. Gamers can also support games that do not have these models. Popular games like Hollow Knight or Cup Head have no modern monetization systems. After you buy the game, you keep it forever! Here are a few examples of good games to support.</p>
